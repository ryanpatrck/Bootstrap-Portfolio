                    <p>My name is Ryan Patrick and I recently graduated from the Valencia College Film Program.  I have worked on a numerous amount of marketing campaigns such as feature films those projects. 
                        I have also compiled a media database to directly contact multiple media sources ranging from newspapers to television and radio stations. 
                   </p>
                    <p>I was also involved with handling communication with these media outlets by phone and by email. I was also involved with organizing and updating email lists and client databases. During my four years at USF, I learned about the marketing process and methods for attracting new customers to the products that match their particular tastes. I currently work for Walt Disney World full time. This experience has given me excellent communication skills that are necessary for interacting with consumers in a positive and encouraging manner. 
                       I am eager to interact with customers, peers, and management alike. I have earned multiple awards at work by providing excellent customer service and going above and beyond the Disney standards of superior customer service.
